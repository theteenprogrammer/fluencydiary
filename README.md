# fluencydiary
A diary or journal to aid in your language learning journey


Maybe I'll try to model the editor on the WordPress editor
The way it'll tie in with language learning is it'll be connected to a dictionary or translation api that you can search through for words or phrases depending on the context.
Maybe I'll try to find some api that rates the text on its level so people can consume the content depending on the level.
I'll try to create some flashcard system with it or connect it to an app like Quizlet, Memrise or Brainscape so you can learn the words because that's what tutors do and this would effectively automate that.

Login + Reg System with cookie save so you login once
Profile to give a little context of what your role is
Text editor + panel with API work
Database oc will be MySQL
Scripting oc PHP

I'll code it & then implement security stuff but this project ain't a rush and imma try implement it into something a lot bigger yeah.
